Slider based on featured posts with thumbnails/featured images attached.

== Description ==
Slider based on featured posts with thumbnails/featured images attached. Can choose number of posts to show, how old the oldest post should be, and which categories of post to include.

Requirements:
- Posts must have a featured image attached
- Featured images/thumbnails of all posts to be featured should be of same aspect ratio - slider will not crop images that are different sizes & will resize around them
- Make sure your categories used are spelled correctly

Features:
- Choose multiple categories of post
- Choose number of slots in slider
- Choose max age of posts to show
	- When posts get too old, they drop off & slider adjusts number of slots automatically (no more old posts creeping back up!)

== Installation ==
1. Upload \"test-plugin.php\" to the \"/wp-content/plugins/\" directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the \"Plugins\" menu in WordPress.
